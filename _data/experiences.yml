  company: Medacuity Software LLC
  details: "Medacuity is a Software consultancy company and is involved in medical devices specifically. It has several clients in this area and provides software support in the development of these devices.
  <br><br>
  In my time there I received the Honoring commitments award for delivering what was promised to client under time crunch and working from India add odd hours to make sure the work was complete.
  <br><br>
  I have been working on projects which require software assistance as a UI and embedded developer. As a part of my role, I aid in the back-end and front-end support of devices that operate in a client-server environment. I also work on communication protocols for devices and their interfaces. These devices go through rigorous testing as they are medical devices and need FDA approval. It has helped me understand the process and, I have become well versed in the ISO: 13485 that is the software guidelines for medical devices."
  software: C++, QNX, Visual studio(C#), python, C, CanBus Communication

  company: FESTO corporation
  details: "Festo is a big name industrial automation and other pneumatic and hydraulic solutions. Recently they have gotten involved in the liquid handling sector for medical laboratories. It includes valves and pipettes. During development, I supported my team by building test benches and graphical user interfaces for test engineers.
  <br><br>
  I learned a lot in terms of communication protocols via Ethernet and serial ports. I was involved in the design and testing of products and helped build the firmware for our systems. Most of my job entailed control of PLCs via various interfaces to integrate different components."
  software: Codesys, Visual studio(C#), Arduino IDE(C++), Labview, ProCreo, WinIdea(firmware)

  role: Engineering intern
  time: July '16 - Aug '16
  company: Persimmon Technologies
  details: "During my internship, I designed a test-bed for encoders. The specifications were:
  <ul>
  <li> Minimum number of encoders that can be fit on the test-bed
  <li> Air gap between encoder and encoder ring,
  <li> Foolproof methods of mounting the encoders with the correct air gap
  <li> Easy mounting and removal of encoders to not disturb other encoders
  <li>Cost effectiveness of the test-bed (parts should be standardized and available from manufacturers instead of needing to be machined)
  </ul>
  The encoders are propitiatory and are manufactured especially for the robots at the company. The encoder rings are also specially designed and, their dimensions aren't standard. That meant that getting standardized parts that fit these specifications in the design was hard. I performed a Trade-off analysis on whether it was easier to design around the standard or make some parts.
  <br><br>
  After many iterations, the design was finalized and is displayed below. It has a total of 25 individual components. 11 of them are standard parts that can be bought by the manufacturer and the rest are designed and will have to be manufactured. On repetition of these components, the whole assembly has 221 components."

  time: May '15 - Jun '15
  company: Maruthi Suzuki India Pvt,ltd
  details: "This internship was a great learning opportunity to see how robots interact with each other and humans in an industrial setting. I studied trajectory controllers for 6-DOF Fanuc and ABB robots for car manufacturing. I also learned how to work with Siemens PLCs(Programmable Logic Controllers) and code them using ladder logic.  I designed a ladder logic to control a bottle filling station using complex pick and place operations with indexing."
  software: SIMANTIC (ladder logic software)
