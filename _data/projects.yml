  title: Emotion detection for children with ASD using deep learning
  link: Emotion_tracking_DL
  time: Aug '17 - Dec '17
  details: "Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is a neurological disorder which causes late development of motor and social skills. PABI(Penguin for Autism Behavioral Intervention) is a robot that helps children with ASD improve their social skills. It is paired with a tablet and gives various audio visual queues as positive reinforcement for right answers.
  <br><br>
 This project futhers the assistance of the robot by making it capable of recognizing emotions. This can show how much of the sessions are helping the child or keeping them involved in the session.
 <br><br>
 During the course of this project, the FERC kaggle dataset was taken. It consisted of 7 emotions namely anger, disgust, happy , sad, surprise, fear and neutral. The dataset had some bad images in it which were removed, it also had uneven amount of data for each label. Anger and disgust were combined to one label as the exhibit a similar negative sentiment. After this all the data was augmented to have the same umber of samples in each label. The data was then put into a pickle file and run on the model. The model consists of various Convolutions, Max-pooling, Flattening, Batch-normalizations and dropout layers with relu and softmax activation functions.
 <br><br>
 The maximum accuracy reached for 6 emotions was 57.22%. Seeing the confusion matrix it was obvious that fear wasn't being detected properly so fear was removed and trained again to reach 68.50%. The highest accuracy recorded on this dataset is 71.2% so 68.5% is good. Another dataset has been obtained since and the model is being trained on that.
 <br><br>
 The video below shows how the trained model work on live video test data. The reults were displayed with the label and the confidence of the label. The final softmax layer was tweaked to show unsure if the confidence was less than 50%. "

  title: Mapping and motion planning on an RC car
  link: motion_planning_project
  time: Jan '17 - May '17
  details: "Motion planning is one of the most important things needed to move a robot. In this project I took 3 motion planning algorithms, A*, RRT* and ARA* and compared them in 3 different Gazebo worlds for completness, optimality, space and time complexity.
  <br><br>
  The 3 worlds are ones with no obstacles, one obstacle and a narrow passage. The goals are the same for each algorithm but change for each world. These algorithms were all coded in c++ with gazebo using ROS. The code can be found in the repo motion_planning_project.
  <br><br>
  The video below shows how each algorithm faired in each world * EXPLAIN MORE HERE AFTER TOUCH UP OF CODE*"
