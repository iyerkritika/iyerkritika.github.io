  company: FESTO corporation
  details: "Festo is a company which is involved in industrial automation and other pneumatic and hydraulic solutions. Recently they have gotten involved in the liquid handling sector for medical laboratories. This includes valves and pipettes. During the development of these systems I have supported my team buy building test benches along with the graphical interfaces for our test engineers. I have also been in talks to integrate machine learning for predictive maintenance of our systems.
  <br><br>
  In my time here so far I have learned a lot in terms of communication protocols via Ethernet and serial ports. I have been involved in the design of certain parts as well as helped build the firmware for our systems. Most of my job entails control of PLCs via various interfaces to make all the parts of the system act as one."
  software: Codesys, Visual studio(C#), Arduino IDE(C++), Labview, ProCreo, WinIdea(firmware)
  

- experience:
  role: Engineering intern
  time: July '16 - Aug '16
  company: Persimmon Technologies
  details: "During my internship, I designed a test bed for encoders. There were many specifications that needed to be met:
  <ul>
  <li> Minimum number of encoders that can be fit on the test bed
  <li> Air gap between encoder and encoder ring,
  <li> Fool proof methods of mounting the encoders with the correct air gap
  <li> Easy mounting and removal of encoders so as to not disturb other encoders
  <li>Cost effectiveness of the test bed (parts should be standardized and available from manufacturers instead of needing to be machined)
  </ul>
  The encoders are propitiatory and are manufactured specially for the robots at the company. The encoder rings are also specially designed hence their dimensions aren't standard. This meant that getting standardized parts that fit these specifications in the design was hard. Trade-off analysis had to be done whether it was easier to design around the standard or make some parts in store.
  <br><br>
  After many iterations the picture below is the design that was finalized. It has a total of 25 individual components out of which 11 are standard parts which can be bought by the manufacturer and the rest are designed. On repetition of these components the whole assembly has 221 components."
  software: Solidworks

  company: Maruthi Suzuki India Pvt,ltd
  details: "This internship was a great learning opportunity to see how robots interact with each other and humans in an industrial setting. I studied trajectory controllers for 6-DOF Fanuc and ABB robots for car manufacturing. I also learned how to work with Seimens PLCs(Programmable Logic Controllers) and code them using ladder logic. Using this I designed a ladder logic to control a bottle filling station using complex pick and place operations with indexing."
  software: SIMANTIC (ladder logic software)
